# Welcome to the Open Photobioreactor project!

‚ùó This is a work in progress project, and this may not presententiont he last development state. Here you can look for our goals.

We have segmented the system into individual components to simplify the choice
and construction of each item, and possible modifications. This choice of components follows two main criteria: price and ease of acquisition of the items.

## The system consists of:

- Reaction bottle
- Bottle cap
- Agitation system
- Nutrient Injection
- Gas inlet and outlet
- Temperature reading and control
- pH reading
- Controlled lighting
- Light and/or color sensor
- Sampling system
- Control boards and software
